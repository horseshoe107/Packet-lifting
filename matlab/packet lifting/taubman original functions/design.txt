% Specify forced zeros for the combined filter via their

% conjugate pairs, regardless of their frequencies.  The remainder
% of the filter design problem consists of finding a linear phase
% common part, Q(z), which can be factorized into minimum and
% maximum phase filters.  We do not include the effect of the
% `forced_zeros' on the stopband, specifically so that we can get
% a stopband whose zeros all exactly touch the origin.  It also
% means that the `forced_zeros' provide stronger attenuation in
% the stopband.

forced_zeros = [1.0]; % Can be a row vector with more entries

% Specify the relative importance assigned to cancelling energy in the
% LL-H (donor) subband, as opposed to minimizing the transfer of
% aliasing energy from the LH-L and HL-L subbands.
